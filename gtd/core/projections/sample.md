## Actions:

-  [ ] `520b1fab` do this anytime @home
-  [ ] `d2e4d9b9` ALSO DO THIS @COMPUTER ANYTIME
-  [?] `612459b6` I'm not sure if this will be necessary or not, best wait and see
1. [x] `76ca05c3` this should happen before any subsequent numbered steps
1. [ ] `5dbb4aa9` **this can't happen until after all previous numbered steps

## Support Materials

### Thoughts about action format:

The ID value (`520b1fab`) immediately following the brackets is the first segment of the UUID serving as the action id.

I'd also like ways to convey urgency and importance in actions:

- Maybe ALL CAPS indicates heightened importance?
- Maybe **bold** indicates heightened urgency?

- `[?]` == Latent
- `[ ]` == Incomplete
- `[x]` == Complete

- [ ] actions that start with a dash can be done in any order
1. [ ] actions that start with a number and period are sequential and must be completed in order. Only display the first unfinished sequential task in context lists. (next task will be presented upon completion of previous task)
