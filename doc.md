# GTD Domain Model


## Important Concepts:

**Action**:
: A well-described, discrete task to be performed, possibly required to achieve an **outcome**. A given task is either incomplete or complete. 

**Action Context**:
: An organizing label appended to a specific **action** to identify the _situation_, _location_, _meeting_, and/or _resources_ which may be required to complete the action.

**Outcome**:
: A condition dependent on completion of multiple **actions**.

**Outcome Status**:
: An organizing attribute assigned to a specific **outcome**. May only be one of the following: _current_, _completed_, _rejected_, _someday_, _maybe_

**Outcome Support Materials**:
: Reference information associated with an **outcome**.

**Script**:
: A sequence of behaviors to facilitate review and completion of tasks.
